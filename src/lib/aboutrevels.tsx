							In 1982, Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, celebrated its Ruby Jubilee. To
							commemorate the milestone, the administration and the students came up with a string of
							events, that aimed at propagating Arts and Culture. From these efforts was born Revels-82-
							"Stormy Interlude", the first edition of the cultural fest, presided by dignitaries led by
							Shri Govind Narain (then Governor of Karnataka state). Over time, the fest has grown to
							mammoth proportions, boasting both sustained participation and an enthused Organizing Team.
